:wave: Hi, I am Stefano
=======================

I am a **Mathematician** :mortar_board: and **Jr. Software Developer**.

I have designed and developed the [SARKAS](https://github.com/murillo-group/sarkas) [website](https://murillo-group.github.io/sarkas/) for the [Murillo-Group at MSU](https://murillogroupmsu.com/) which went live November 2021. It was built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org), a Python static website generator that is mainly used for documentation-type websites.

In February 2022 I have restyled my old website. I built it with [11ty](https://11ty.dev), the wonderfully simple Static Site Generator created by Zach Leatherman.  

At the moment I work at [OLab s.r.l.s.](https://olab-studio.com), a small team of amazing Django/Python developers located around Italy, and also as a sub-contractor with [SAS Italy](https://www.sas.com/it_it/home.html).
