Hi there ðŸ‘‹
===========

I am a **Mathematician** :mortar_board: and aspiring **Full Stack Developer**.

I do enjoy applying my analytical reasoning skills to challenges in other fields. In fact, I learned how to code in several programming/markup languages mostly by myself.

In the Fall 2021 I enrolled in a 14-weeks bootcamp to become a Full Stack Developer @[EPICODE School](https://epicode.it).

I have helped design and create the [SARKAS](https://github.com/murillo-group/sarkas) [website](murillo-group.github.io/sarkas) for the [Murillo-Group at MSU](https://murillogroupmsu.com/) way before enrolling in the bootcamp.
