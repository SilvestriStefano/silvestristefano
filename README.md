:wave: Hi, I am Stefano
=======================

I am a **Mathematician** :mortar_board: and aspiring **Full Stack Developer**.

I do enjoy applying my analytical reasoning skills to challenges in other fields. In fact, I learned how to code in several programming/markup languages mostly by myself.

In the Fall 2021 I enrolled in a 14(+3)-weeks bootcamp @[EPICODE School](https://epicode.it) to become a Full Stack Developer.

I have helped design and create the [SARKAS](https://github.com/murillo-group/sarkas) [website](https://murillo-group.github.io/sarkas/) for the [Murillo-Group at MSU](https://murillogroupmsu.com/) way before enrolling in the bootcamp. It was built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org), a Python static website generator that is mainly used for documentation-type websites.
