Hi there ðŸ‘‹
===========

I am a **Mathematician** and aspiring **Full Stack Developer**.

I learned how to code in several programming/markup languages mostly by myself. Clearly my approach to coding is shaped by my mathematics background and love for solving problems.

At the moment, I am enrolled in a bootcamp to become a Full Stack Developer @[EPICODE School](https://epicode.it).

I have helped design and create the [SARKAS](https://github.com/murillo-group/sarkas) [website](murillo-group.github.io/sarkas) for the [Murillo-Group at MSU](https://murillogroupmsu.com/) way before enrolling in the bootcamp.
